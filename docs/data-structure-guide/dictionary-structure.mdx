# Dictionary Structure

Fist of all, let's define the most important terms that we are using in our dictionary data structure:

## Expression

A word or a phrase in a language. It can be a single word, a phrase, or a sentence, but currently it is mostly a single word and rarely a short phrase.

### Example

In the image below the word in red **"КЬИГЪИТI"** is an expression.

![Expression](./img/dict-example-1.jpg)

### JSON representation

In JSON the expression is represented as an object which encapsulates the expression spelling and its details:

```js
{
  "expression": {
    // highlight-next-line
    "spelling": [ "КЬИГЪИТI" ],
    "details": [ /* Expression details go here ... */ ]
  }
}
```

As you've probably noticed, the `spelling` is an array of strings. This is because some expressions have multiple spellings. For example the word **"МАРЦ"** can be written as **"МАРЦАР"** and both are correct.

![Expression with multiple spellings](./img/dict-example-multi-spelling.jpg)

The same holds for **"ШИХИН"** and **"ШИХИНИН"**

![Expression with multiple spellings](./img/dict-example-multi-spelling-2.jpg)

So in these cases JSON will look like this:

```js
{
  "expression": {
    // highlight-next-line
    "spelling": [ "МАРЦ", "МАРЦАР" ],
    "details": [ /* Expression details go here ... */ ]
  }
}
// and
{
  "expression": {
    // highlight-next-line
    "spelling": [ "ШИХИН", "ШИХИНИН" ],
    "details": [ /* Expression details go here ... */ ]
  }
}
```

### Database table

The most important columns in `Expression` table in the database are `spelling` and `language_id`. The column `spelling` has the same meaning as in JSON except for the fact that each `spelling` has its own unique record in database. The `language_id` is a foreign key to the `Language` table which is at the same time an [ISO 639-3 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) of the language. For example the ISO 639-3 code for Lezgi is **lez**.

All other relations for this table are done by using `expression.id` as a foregn key

## Expression details

Some expressions have multiple definitions that are varying too much from each other ([homonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym)). In this case the authors write it down multiple times (mostly annotated with Roman numerals). We are bundling this kind of translations together and we call each of those transations **expression details**.

Expression details is build up from:
1. **Definition details** list
2. **Examples** list

Both of those lists are optional and can be empty, but it rarely happens for both of them at the same time.

### Example

Below we see expression **"КЬИЛЕЛ"** which not only has 3 different translations, but all of them also differ as part of speech:
- `КЬИЛЕЛ I` - (_сущ._) **noun**
- `КЬИЛЕЛ II` - (_нареч._) **adverb**
- `КЬИЛЕЛ III` - (_посл._) **afterword**

This is an example of expression **"КЬИЛЕЛ"** with 3 expression details


## Inflection

[Inflection](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/inflection) is the way word changes its form based on the context where it is used. From example above an inflection of the word **"КЬИГЪИТI"** is **(-ди, -да, -ри)**

Because of the fact that different **expression details** of the same **expression** can differ quite a lot (not only in meaning but also in grammar) they often have different inflections like in the example below:

![Multiple inflections](./img/dict-example-multi-inflection.jpg)

This is the reason why we have chosen to set `inflection` on the level of **expression details** both in JSON and in database

```js
{
  "spelling": [ "ЛЕКЬ" ],
  "details": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "inflection": "-ре, -ре, -ери",
      "definitionDetails": [ ... ],
      "examples": [ ... ]
    },
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "inflection": "-ини, -ина, -ери",
      "definitionDetails": [ ... ],
      "examples": [ ... ]
    },
    {
      "definitionDetails": [ ... ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Definition details

In the same way as expression details, definition details are a list of definitions that are varying from each other, but the difference is not as big as in expression details.

Definition details is build up from:
1. **Definitions** list
2. **Examples** list

### Example

For example here the expression **"КЬЕРКЬ"** has 3 translations, but they are all nouns and all of them are related:

1. old term
2. dialect
3. figurative meaning

![Definition Details](./img/dict-example-3.jpg)

## Definitions

Definition is the actual translation (or meaning in case of explanatory dictionary) of the expression. There can be multiple definitions within a single **definition detail** but they are all closely related to each other, one could even say they are all synonyms.

### Example

Here for the _adverb_ **"КЬЕРИЗ-КЬЕРИЗ"** we see that each line (_definition detail_) contains multiple comma separated definitions and they all mean the same thing:

1. occasionally, sometimes, not often
2. finely, very fine

Here are "occasionally, sometimes, not often" a list of definitions and each of them is a **definition**.
